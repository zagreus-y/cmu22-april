        <h2>What is a Hackathon?</h2>
        <p>A hackathon is an event, usually hosted by a tech company or organization, where programmers get together for a short period of time to collaborate on a project. The participants work rapidly and often work without sleep to achieve their task, as the events generally only last 24 hours or take place over a weekend. </p>

        <h2>Why participate in a Hacktahon?</h2>
        <p>
            <h4>Teamwork </h4>Hackathon teaches you how to work as a team and to be humble about letting go of your ideas once in a while. <p>
                <p>
                    <h4>Leadership</h4>It’s the best place to learn, teach, challenge, test, and share everything! Ideas, technologies and methodologies. Hackathon is for those who believe that collaborating we can transform.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h4>Innovation</h4>During a hackathon, innovation is in the air! This is the time to use the latest technologies, learn new programming languages and, especially, take risks!
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h4>Self-confidence</h4> Comming up with new ideas and implementing them in such a short amount of time gives immense satisfaction. At the end of the hackathon you know more than you knew before participating.
